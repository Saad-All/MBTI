## 4. Functionality & Verification:
- [x] Functionality has been manually verified by the developer.
- [x] Edge cases and potential error conditions considered and handled gracefully.
  - Invalid SAIS distributions
  - Missing required fields
  - Invalid dimension values

## 5. Story Administration:

- [x] Completion notes documented in story file.
- [x] Agent model and changelog properly updated.

## 6. Dependencies, Build & Configuration:
- [x] Project builds successfully without errors (TypeScript checks pass).
- [x] Project linting passes (no ESLint errors).
- [x] No new dependencies added.
- [N/A] No new environment variables introduced.

## 7. Documentation:
- [x] Relevant inline code documentation complete.
- [N/A] User-facing documentation - Not required for this backend story.
- [x] Technical documentation updated (file list and implementation details).

## Final Confirmation

### Summary:
Successfully implemented the MBTI scoring algorithm with:
- Core calculation service supporting binary and SAIS methodologies
- Comprehensive validation service with SAIS 5-point checks
- Performant API route with caching
- Extensive test coverage with 10+ test cases
- Full TypeScript type safety

### Technical Notes:
- Edge Runtime temporarily disabled (as noted in previous story)
- Using in-memory cache for demonstration (production would need Redis/similar)
- Test runner implemented but not integrated with Jest/testing framework

### Follow-up Work:
- Integrate with proper testing framework when available
- Consider persistent caching solution for production
- Add monitoring/analytics for scoring accuracy

- [x] I, the Developer Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed.
