## Final Confirmation

### Summary of Accomplishments:
Successfully implemented the complete interim results and format selection flow for Story 1.4. This includes:
- Interim results API that calculates preliminary MBTI type from 4 core questions
- Beautiful interim results page showing type tendency and personality insights
- Format selection interface with 3 distinct assessment methodologies
- Complete rollback strategy with environment variables
- Full bilingual support for English and Arabic
- One-way navigation to prevent gaming the system

### Items Not Done:
- Unit/Integration tests: The project doesn't have Jest or any test framework configured yet. I created a test file but had to remove it.

### Technical Debt/Follow-up:
- Testing framework should be set up for the project to enable proper unit testing
- Consider adding visual regression tests for the UI components

### Challenges/Learnings:
- Worked around the lack of testing framework by ensuring thorough manual verification
- Implemented comprehensive rollback strategy as specified in the story

### Ready for Review:
- [x] I, the Developer Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed and the story is ready for review.
