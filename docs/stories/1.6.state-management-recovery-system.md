# Story 1.6: State Management & Recovery System

## Status
Done / Skipped some part should review later on after deployment

## Story
**As a** user taking the assessment,  
**I want** my progress automatically saved and recoverable,  
**so that** I never lose my responses due to technical issues or interruptions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Assessment progress automatically saved after each question response
2. Multiple persistence layers: localStorage, sessionStorage, and server-side backup
3. State recovery works after browser refresh, tab closure, and device restart
4. Server-side session backup API route stores essential progress data
5. Recovery system detects existing progress and offers to continue or restart
6. State includes question responses, current position, format selection, interim results, and language preference
7. Graceful handling of storage quota exceeded or privacy settings blocking local storage
8. Assessment session expires after 3 hours to maintain data hygiene
9. Cross-language state recovery maintains assessment integrity when switching languages

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5 completion:
- Enhanced state management already preserves language preference across assessment reset operations
- Zustand store includes language field with proper persistence
- Assessment flow maintains integrity through proper state management
- Language switching works seamlessly without progress loss established

### Current Infrastructure Analysis
**✅ Already Implemented:**
- Basic Zustand store with assessment state [Source: src/lib/stores/assessment-store.ts]
- SessionStorage persistence hook for basic state saving [Source: src/lib/hooks/useAssessmentPersistence.ts]
- Assessment state includes language preference and interim results
- State structure follows AssessmentSession data model [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#AssessmentSession]

**⚠️ Missing Requirements for AC Compliance:**
- No server-side session backup API route (AC: 2, 4)
- No localStorage layer (only sessionStorage) (AC: 2)
- No storage quota/privacy graceful handling (AC: 7)
- No session expiration (3 hours requirement) (AC: 8)
- No recovery system offering continue/restart (AC: 5)
- No multiple persistence layers coordination (AC: 2)

### Data Models
**Assessment Session Core Structure** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#AssessmentSession]:
```typescript
interface AssessmentSession {
  sessionId: string;
  language: 'en' | 'ar';
  currentStep: AssessmentStep;
  startTime: Date;
  completionTime?: Date;
  selectedFormat?: 'scenarios' | 'traits' | 'sais';
  coreResponses: QuestionResponse[];
  extendedResponses: QuestionResponse[];
  calculatedType?: string;
  confidence?: number;
  progress: number;
  isComplete: boolean;
}
```

**Current State Implementation Gap Analysis**:
- ✅ sessionId, language, currentStep, selectedFormat, progress, isComplete present
- ⚠️ Missing startTime, completionTime, coreResponses/extendedResponses separation
- ⚠️ Missing calculatedType, confidence for interim results

### API Specifications
**Required Server-Side Backup Endpoint** [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]:
```typescript
// POST /api/assessment/progress
interface ProgressBackupRequest {
  sessionId: string;
  sessionData: AssessmentSession;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// GET /api/assessment/progress/{sessionId}
interface ProgressRecoveryResponse {
  sessionData: AssessmentSession | null;
  lastSaved: Date;
  isExpired: boolean;
}
```

### Component Specifications
**Service Layer Requirements** [Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#ServiceLayer]:
- `StorageService.ts` - localStorage abstraction with graceful fallbacks
- `AssessmentService.ts` - Business logic for progress backup and recovery
- Enhanced Zustand store for multi-layer persistence coordination

**Frontend Architecture Integration** [Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#StateManagement]:
```typescript
interface AppState {
  assessment: {
    sessionId: string;
    currentStep: AssessmentStep;
    language: 'en' | 'ar';
    responses: QuestionResponse[];
    selectedFormat: 'scenarios' | 'traits' | 'sais' | null;
    progress: number;
    isComplete: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Technical Constraints
**State Management Technology** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]:

## Rollback Strategy & Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risk Assessment
**Primary Risks Identified:**
1. **Multi-Layer Storage Conflicts** - New storage coordination breaking existing persistence
2. **Server Backup API Issues** - Network failures or API errors disrupting client-side flow
3. **Storage Service Failures** - Graceful fallback logic causing unexpected behavior
4. **Session Expiration Too Aggressive** - 3-hour timeout losing active user sessions
5. **Recovery Dialog Interference** - Recovery UI disrupting normal assessment start flow
6. **Store Enhancement Breaking State** - Enhanced Zustand store causing state corruption

### Rollback Procedures by Task

#### Task 1: Server-Side Session Backup API Rollback
**Trigger Conditions:**
- Server backup API errors >5%
- Network request timeouts affecting client flow
- Assessment completion rate drops due to backup failures

**Rollback Steps:**
```bash
# Emergency rollback - remove server backup
rm -rf src/app/api/assessment/progress/
git checkout src/lib/hooks/useAssessmentPersistence.ts
# Disable server backup calls in store
# Test client-side persistence isolation
```

**Validation:** Test localStorage and sessionStorage work independently

#### Task 2: Multi-Layer Storage Service Rollback
**Trigger Conditions:**
- Storage quota handling causing data loss
- Graceful fallback logic creating conflicts
- Client storage performance degradation

**Rollback Steps:**
```typescript
// Remove StorageService abstraction
rm src/lib/services/StorageService.ts
// Restore direct storage calls
git checkout src/lib/stores/assessment-store.ts
// Remove graceful fallback complexity
```

**Files to Restore:** Direct localStorage usage, simple storage calls

#### Task 3: Enhanced Assessment Store Rollback
**Trigger Conditions:**
- State corruption or inconsistency issues
- Assessment flow breaking due to store changes
- Session recovery failures

**Rollback Steps:**
```typescript
// CRITICAL - restore original store structure
git checkout src/lib/stores/assessment-store.ts
// Remove new fields: startTime, completionTime, calculatedType
// Restore original persistence logic
// Clear corrupted localStorage entries
```

#### Task 4: Recovery System Rollback
**Trigger Conditions:**
- Recovery dialog preventing normal assessment start
- User confusion with continue/restart options
- Recovery logic interfering with fresh sessions

**Rollback Steps:**
```typescript
// Remove recovery components
rm src/components/assessment/RecoveryDialog.tsx
// Remove recovery detection logic
// Restore direct assessment start flow
```

#### Task 5: Session Expiration Rollback
**Trigger Conditions:**
- User complaints about lost sessions
- 3-hour timeout too aggressive for assessment completion
- Expiration logic causing premature session loss

**Rollback Steps:**
```typescript
// Remove session expiration
// Restore no timeout or extend to 24 hours
// Clear expiration flags from stored sessions
// Remove cleanup logic
```

#### Task 6: Assessment Persistence Hook Rollback
**Trigger Conditions:**
- Hook enhancement breaking existing persistence
- Multi-layer coordination causing race conditions
- Storage synchronization issues

**Rollback Steps:**
```typescript
// Restore original persistence hook
git checkout src/lib/hooks/useAssessmentPersistence.ts
// Remove multi-layer coordination
// Test simple sessionStorage persistence
```

### Feature Flag Implementation
**Recommended Safety Mechanism:**
```typescript
const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  MULTI_LAYER_STORAGE: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MULTI_STORAGE === 'true',
  SERVER_BACKUP: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SERVER_BACKUP === 'true',
  SESSION_EXPIRATION: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_EXPIRATION === 'true',
  RECOVERY_DIALOG: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_RECOVERY === 'true',
  ENHANCED_STORE: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ENHANCED_STORE === 'true'
};
```

### Monitoring-Based Rollback Triggers
**Auto-rollback conditions:**
- Assessment completion rate drops >5%
- Session recovery failures >3%
- Storage errors >2%
- Server backup failures >10%

### Complete System Rollback
**Nuclear Option - Full Story Rollback:**
```bash
# Complete rollback to pre-enhancement state
git revert [story-start-commit]..[story-end-commit]
# Restore original simple persistence
git checkout src/lib/stores/assessment-store.ts src/lib/hooks/useAssessmentPersistence.ts
# Remove server backup API
rm -rf src/app/api/assessment/progress/
# Test basic assessment flow
```

### Storage Layer Priority Fallback
**Graceful degradation sequence:**
1. **Full Multi-Layer** (localStorage + sessionStorage + server)
2. **Client-Only** (localStorage + sessionStorage)
3. **Session-Only** (sessionStorage only)
4. **Memory-Only** (in-memory state, no persistence)

### Post-Rollback Validation Checklist
**Must verify after any rollback:**
- [ ] Assessment progress saves correctly
- [ ] Browser refresh maintains state
- [ ] Tab closure/reopen recovery works
- [ ] No storage quota exceeded errors
- [ ] Assessment completion flow unbroken
- [ ] No console errors during persistence
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable
- [ ] Language switching preserves state

### Rollback Communication Plan
**Internal Team:**
- Immediate Slack notification with storage metrics
- GitHub issue creation with reproduction steps
- Stakeholder notification within 30 minutes

**User Communication:**
- No user notification for backend rollbacks
- If recovery UI removed, ensure seamless fallback
