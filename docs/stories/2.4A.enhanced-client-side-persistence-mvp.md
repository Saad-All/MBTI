# Story 2.4A: Enhanced Client-Side Persistence & Recovery (MVP)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user progressing through my chosen format,  
**I want** my extended assessment progress continuously saved with enhanced recovery capabilities,  
**so that** I can complete my assessment reliably even with interruptions or technical issues.

## Acceptance Criteria (MVP Focus)
1. Extended assessment state includes format choice, question responses, and current position
2. Auto-save triggers after each question response with enhanced client-side persistence
3. State recovery detects interruptions and offers seamless continuation from exact position
4. Format-specific progress tracking maintains separate question pools and numbering
5. Assessment data structure supports SAIS distribution and binary formats without conflicts
6. State expiration extended to 48 hours for users in extended assessment phase
7. Enhanced recovery dialog provides clear continuation options after interruptions
8. Client-side storage optimization for complex SAIS distribution data

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 1.6 completion:
- Basic state management implemented with multi-layer persistence (localStorage, sessionStorage, memory)
- Session expiration set to 3 hours (needs extension to 48 hours for extended assessment)
- Some parts of state management were skipped and need review/completion
- StorageService provides graceful fallback chain with health checking

From Story 2.3 completion:
- SAIS methodology questions implemented with 5-point distribution responses
- Complex distribution data (distributionA, distributionB) requires robust persistence
- SAISQuestionService created for dynamic question loading
- Enhanced MBTICalculatorService with SAIS-specific scoring needs state backup
- Format-specific progress tracking already partially implemented

### Current State Management Analysis
**✅ Existing Infrastructure:**
- **StorageService**: Multi-layer fallback (localStorage → sessionStorage → memory) [Source: src/lib/services/StorageService.ts]
- **Assessment Store**: Enhanced with coreResponses/extendedResponses separation [Source: src/lib/stores/assessment-store.ts]
- **Persistence Hook**: Basic auto-save and recovery with storage health checking [Source: src/lib/hooks/useAssessmentPersistence.ts]
- **Data Structure**: Supports both binary and distribution response types

**⚠️ MVP Enhancement Requirements:**
- Session expiration limited to 3 hours (AC: 6 - needs 48 hours for extended assessment)
- Format-specific progress tracking needs refinement (AC: 4)
- Recovery system needs enhancement for exact position continuation (AC: 3)
- Client-side storage optimization for SAIS distribution data (AC: 8)

**🔄 Deferred to Story 2.4B (Post-MVP):**
- Server-side backup API with every 2 questions backup
- Advanced error handling with user notifications and retry systems
- Storage health monitoring and proactive notifications
- Advanced backup conflict resolution and offline mode detection

### Extended Assessment Data Requirements
**SAIS Distribution Response Complexity** [Source: Story 2.3 completion]:
```typescript
interface QuestionResponse {
  responseId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  questionId: number;
  questionType: 'core' | 'extended';
  responseType: 'binary' | 'distribution';
  
  // Binary responses (Scenarios, Traits)
  selectedOption?: 'A' | 'B';
  
  // SAIS distribution responses (5-point allocation)
  distributionA?: number; // 0-5
  distributionB?: number; // 0-5
  
  responseTime: Date;
  timeSpent: number;
  mbtiDimension: 'E-I' | 'S-N' | 'T-F' | 'J-P';
}
```

**Format-Specific Progress Tracking**:
- **Core Questions**: Questions 1-4 (shared across all formats)
- **Extended SAIS**: Questions 5-16 (12 SAIS distribution questions)
- **Extended Scenarios/Traits**: Questions 5-16 (12 binary questions/ multi choice questions) - for future implementation
- Total questions vary by format: SAIS=16, Others=16

### Client-Side Storage Optimization
**SAIS Distribution Data Optimization**:
- Enhanced storage for 5-point distribution responses (distributionA/distributionB pairs)
- Optimized serialization for complex assessment state during extended sessions
- Efficient storage compression for 16-question SAIS assessments
- Format-specific storage strategies for different response types

### Session Expiration Enhancement
**48-Hour Extended Session** (AC: 6):
- Current: 3 hours for core assessment [Source: Story 1.6]
- Required: 48 hours for extended assessment phase (after format selection)
- Implement phase-based expiration logic
- Add automatic session extension during active extended assessment

### File Locations (MVP Focus)
Based on existing architecture patterns:
- **Enhanced Persistence Hook**: `src/lib/hooks/useAssessmentPersistence.ts` (needs enhancement)
- **Session Management**: `src/lib/services/SessionService.ts` (needs creation for client-side session logic)
- **Recovery Dialog**: `src/components/assessment/RecoveryDialog.tsx` (exists, needs enhancement)
- **Enhanced Assessment Store**: `src/lib/stores/assessment-store.ts` (needs format-specific progress logic)
- **Storage Optimization**: Enhanced `src/lib/services/StorageService.ts` for SAIS data

### Project Structure Assessment (MVP Scope)
**Current Implementation Status:**
1. **Multi-Layer Storage**: ✅ Implemented with graceful fallback
2. **Extended Session Management**: ⚠️ Missing - needs 48-hour expiration logic (MVP)
3. **Format-Specific Progress**: ⚠️ Partial - needs refinement for SAIS vs other formats (MVP)
4. **Enhanced Recovery**: ⚠️ Basic recovery exists, needs exact position continuation (MVP)
5. **SAIS Storage Optimization**: ⚠️ Missing - needs optimization for distribution data (MVP)

**Deferred to Post-MVP (Story 2.4B):**
- Server-side backup API and integration
- Advanced error handling with user notification system
- Storage health monitoring and proactive notifications
- Backup conflict resolution and offline mode detection

**Architecture Alignment:**
- Storage service follows established patterns ✅
- Assessment store structure supports extended responses ✅  
- Persistence hooks integrate with existing state management ✅

  getSessionTimeout: () => EMERGENCY_SESSION_TIMEOUT,
  isExtendedPhase: () => false, // Force core session logic
}

// Remove SessionService integration
// Revert to Story 1.6 basic session management
```

**Files to Restore:**

  },
  
  // Remove SAIS-specific optimization
  getItem: (key: string) => {
    return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key) || 'null');
  }
}
```

**Files to Restore:**

  }
}

// Remove save confirmation feedback
// Remove queue management complexity
```

**Files to Restore:**
