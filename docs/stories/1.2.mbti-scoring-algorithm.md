# Story 1.2: MBTI Scoring Algorithm Implementation

## Status
Done partially

## Story
**As a** system,  
**I want** a reliable MBTI calculation engine that produces accurate personality type results from user responses,  
**so that** users receive trustworthy personality insights they can act upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. MBTI scoring algorithm implemented supporting both binary choices and 5-point distribution system for E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P dimensions
2. Algorithm validated against minimum 10 known test cases with expected MBTI outcomes across all three methodologies
3. Edge Runtime API route `/api/calculate-mbti` accepts response arrays and methodology type, returns personality type
4. Interim scoring capability for 4-question preliminary results using simplified binary scoring
5. Full scoring capability supporting all three methodologies: Life Scenarios (binary), A/B Choice (binary), and SAIS Methodology (5-point distribution)
6. Response caching implemented to optimize performance for concurrent users
7. Error handling returns appropriate fallback responses for invalid inputs and validates 5-point distribution totals for SAIS methodology
8. SAIS methodology scoring prevents ties through 5-point system ensuring clear dimensional preferences

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Source: [docs/stories/1.1.project-foundation.md#dev-agent-record]**
- ✅ Project foundation established with Next.js 14.2+, TypeScript 5.3+, and Edge Runtime support
- ✅ State management implemented with Zustand store at `src/lib/stores/assessment-store.ts`
- ✅ TypeScript type definitions available at `src/lib/types/index.ts`
- ⚠️ Edge Runtime temporarily disabled due to compatibility issues - can be re-enabled for production

### Data Models
**Source: [docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]**
- **QuestionResponse interface** already defined with support for both binary and distribution responses:
  ```typescript
  interface QuestionResponse {
    responseId: string;
    sessionId: string;
    questionId: number;
    questionType: 'core' | 'extended';
    responseType: 'binary' | 'distribution';
    selectedOption?: 'A' | 'B';  // For binary responses
    distributionA?: number; // 0-5 for SAIS
    distributionB?: number; // 0-5 for SAIS
    mbtiDimension: 'E-I' | 'S-N' | 'T-F' | 'J-P';
  }
  ```
- **MBTIResults interface** defined with dimension scores and confidence levels
- **SAIS Validation** function template provided with valid combinations: (5,0), (4,1), (3,2), (2,3), (1,4), (0,5)

### API Specifications
**Source: [docs/architecture/5-api-specification.md]**
- **API Route**: `/api/assessment/calculate` (POST)
- **Request format**: `{ sessionId: string, responses: QuestionResponse[] }`
- **Response format**: Returns MBTIResults with calculated type and confidence
- **OpenAPI 3.0 specification** already defined for all endpoints

### Backend Architecture 
**Source: [docs/architecture/11-backend-architecture.md]**
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Use `src/lib/services/` for business logic
- **MBTICalculatorService.ts**: Main calculation engine service
- **ValidationService.ts**: Response validation service
- **API Routes Structure**: Follow `src/app/api/assessment/calculate/route.ts` pattern

### SAIS Scoring Algorithm
**Source: [docs/prd/sample-questions-scoring-system.md]**
- **Total Points**: 60 (12 questions × 5 points) for full SAIS assessment
- **Per Dimension**: 15 points (3 questions × 5 points)
- **Dimension Mapping**:
  - E/I: Questions 1-3 (A=I, B=E)
  - S/N: Questions 4-6 (A=N, B=S)  
  - T/F: Questions 7-9 (A=T, B=F)
  - J/P: Questions 10-12 (A=J, B=P)
- **No Ties**: 5-point distribution ensures clear preferences

### Technical Constraints
**Source: [docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md]**
- **TypeScript**: 5.3+ with strict mode enabled
- **Runtime**: Edge Runtime compatible (currently disabled, use standard Node.js)
- **Next.js**: 14.2+ with App Router structure
- **Performance**: Response caching required for concurrent users

## Testing

### Testing Standards
No specific testing framework found in architecture docs. Implement basic testing approach:
- **Manual Testing**: Validate algorithm against 10+ known test cases
- **API Testing**: Test endpoint with Postman/curl for request/response validation  
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions with Jest (if available)
- **Integration Testing**: Test complete calculation flow with sample data
- **SAIS Validation**: Verify 5-point distribution constraints work correctly
