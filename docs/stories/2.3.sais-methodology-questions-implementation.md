# Story 2.3: SAIS Methodology Questions Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review


## Story
**As a** user who chose SAIS Methodology,  
**I want** to answer 12 consciousness-focused questions using a 5-point distribution system that prevents ties,  
**so that** I receive deep, spiritually-aware personality insights based on internal awareness and energy dynamics.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. 12 SAIS methodology questions covering remaining MBTI dimensions with consciousness-based framing
2. 5-point distribution interface for each question (users allocate 5 points between A and B options)
3. Visual point allocation system with sliders or point selectors preventing ties
4. Questions focus on internal awareness, energy dynamics, and consciousness themes
5. Progress indicator continues from interim results (questions 5-16 of total assessment)
6. Input validation ensures exactly 5 points distributed per question before proceeding
7. Questions dynamically loaded based on interim results using SAIS methodology sample questions
8. Arabic language support with culturally appropriate consciousness-based terminology
9. Scoring system tracks point distribution for accurate MBTI calculation
10. Mobile-optimized point distribution interface with clear visual feedback
11. The Data/Questions are already in MBTI\src\data\questions\SAIS_questions.md || src\data\results\MBTI_All_Types_Cleaned.md

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Epic 1 completion:
- Arabic language infrastructure fully implemented (Story 1.5)
- State management with language preference and assessment persistence (Stories 1.4, 1.6)
- MBTI calculation engine supports multiple methodologies [Source: src/lib/services/MBTICalculatorService.ts]
- Existing QuestionCard and BinaryChoice components provide UI foundation

### SAIS Data Analysis
**✅ Available SAIS Question Content:**
- Original SAIS methodology reference: `docs/SAIS_questions.md` with 12 questions, scoring examples, and MBTI mappings ✅
- Arabic SAIS questions: `src/data/questions/sais-ar.json` with 12 consciousness-focused questions ✅
- Structured implementation data: `src/data/questions/SAIS_questions.md` with detailed instructions ✅
- Questions cover all MBTI dimensions (E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P) with consciousness-based framing
- Arabic translations include culturally appropriate spiritual terminology
- Reference document includes sample answer methodology with MBTI code mappings [Source: docs/SAIS_questions.md]

**Current Data Structure Analysis:**
```json
// sais-ar.json structure
{
  "assessment": {
    "sais": {
      "intro": { "title": "منهجية التوزيع الخماسي SAIS", "description": "..." },
      "instructions": { "title": "تعليمات التوزيع:", "examples": [...] },
      "questions": [
        {
          "id": "sais_1",
          "dimension": "E/I", 
          "statement": "في المواقف الاجتماعية، أجد نفسي:",
          "optionA": "أسعى للتفاعل مع أكبر عدد من الأشخاص...",
          "optionB": "أفضل المحادثات العميقة مع عدد قليل...",
          "optionATendency": "E",
          "optionBTendency": "I"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Model Compliance
**SAIS Response Structure** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#QuestionResponse]:
```typescript
interface QuestionResponse {
  responseId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  questionId: number;
  questionType: 'core' | 'extended';
  responseType: 'binary' | 'distribution';
  
  // SAIS distribution responses (must total exactly 5)
  distributionA?: number; // 0-5
  distributionB?: number; // 0-5
  
  responseTime: Date;
  timeSpent: number;
  mbtiDimension: 'E-I' | 'S-N' | 'T-F' | 'J-P';
}
```

**SAIS Validation Requirements** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#SAISValidation]:
```typescript
function validateSAISDistribution(pointA: number, pointB: number): boolean {
  return (
    pointA >= 0 && pointA <= 5 &&
    pointB >= 0 && pointB <= 5 &&
    pointA + pointB === 5 &&
    Number.isInteger(pointA) &&
    Number.isInteger(pointB)
  );
}

// Valid SAIS combinations: (5,0), (4,1), (3,2), (2,3), (1,4), (0,5)
```

### Component Architecture Requirements
**Missing SAIS-Specific Components** [Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#ComponentOrganization]:
- `SAISDistribution.tsx` - 5-point distribution UI component (not yet created)
- SAIS page route: `src/app/[locale]/assessment/sais/page.tsx` (not yet created)

**Existing Component Foundation:**
- ✅ `QuestionCard.tsx` - Generic question wrapper with RTL support
- ✅ `BinaryChoice.tsx` - Can serve as pattern for SAIS selection UI
- ✅ `ProgressBar.tsx` - Assessment progress tracking
- ✅ UI components: `Button.tsx`, `Slider.tsx` available for distribution interface

### MBTI Calculator Integration
**Existing SAIS Support** [Source: src/lib/services/MBTICalculatorService.ts]:
- ✅ MBTICalculatorService supports `MethodologyType` including SAIS
- ✅ `calculateDimensionScores()` method handles different response types
- ✅ Distribution-based scoring logic needs verification for 5-point system

**Missing Integration:**
- No English SAIS questions (only Arabic available currently)
- SAIS methodology scoring verification needed
- Distribution response type handling in calculator

### Technical Constraints
**State Management Integration** [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]:
- **State Management**: Zustand store must track SAIS distribution responses
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form for complex 5-point validation
- **UI Components**: Radix UI Slider for point distribution interface

**Mobile Optimization Requirements**:
- Touch-friendly point allocation interface
- Clear visual feedback for distribution values
- RTL support for Arabic users with proper slider orientation

### File Locations
Based on architecture patterns [Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]:
- **Reference Document**: `docs/SAIS_questions.md` - Original 12 questions with scoring methodology and MBTI mappings
- **SAIS Page Route**: `src/app/[locale]/assessment/sais/page.tsx`
- **SAIS Distribution Component**: `src/components/assessment/SAISDistribution.tsx`
- **English SAIS Questions**: `src/data/questions/sais-en.json` (needs creation based on reference document)
- **SAIS Question Service**: Enhanced question loading service for SAIS format

### Project Structure Assessment
**Current Implementation Status:**
1. **Arabic SAIS Content**: ✅ Complete with consciousness-based terminology
2. **English SAIS Content**: ⚠️ Missing - needs creation based on Arabic version
3. **SAIS UI Components**: ⚠️ Missing - SAISDistribution component needed
4. **SAIS Page Route**: ⚠️ Missing - dedicated SAIS assessment page needed
5. **Calculator Integration**: ⚠️ Partial - needs SAIS-specific distribution handling

**Architecture Alignment:**
- SAIS questions follow established data model patterns ✅
- Response structure aligns with QuestionResponse interface ✅
- Validation logic matches architecture specification ✅
