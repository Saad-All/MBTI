# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Assessment Flow

**Epic Goal:** Establish complete project infrastructure (Next.js application, Edge Runtime API routes, Vercel deployment pipeline) while delivering the core MBTI assessment functionality that allows users to answer 4 foundation questions, receive interim personality insights, and choose their preferred format for extended assessment. This epic delivers immediate user value through the innovative interim results feature while building all technical foundations needed for subsequent epics.

### Story 1.1: Project Foundation & Deployment Pipeline
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a complete Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel deployment configured,  
**so that** I have a solid foundation for rapid development and can deploy changes immediately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Next.js 13+ application initialized with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and i18n configuration
2. Git repository connected to Vercel with automatic deployment pipeline
3. Edge Runtime configured for API routes with performance monitoring
4. Development environment includes hot reload and debugging capabilities
5. Basic health check API route returns 200 status and deployment timestamp
6. Custom domain configured with SSL certificate
7. Environment variable management set up for OpenAI API keys and configuration
8. Internationalization setup with Arabic (ar) and English (en) locale support
9. RTL CSS configuration and Arabic font loading implemented
10. Language detection and routing functionality working correctly

### Story 1.2: MBTI Scoring Algorithm Implementation
**As a** system,  
**I want** a reliable MBTI calculation engine that produces accurate personality type results from user responses,  
**so that** users receive trustworthy personality insights they can act upon.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. MBTI scoring algorithm implemented supporting both binary choices and 5-point distribution system for E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P dimensions
2. Algorithm validated against minimum 10 known test cases with expected MBTI outcomes across all three methodologies
3. Edge Runtime API route `/api/calculate-mbti` accepts response arrays and methodology type, returns personality type
4. Interim scoring capability for 4-question preliminary results using simplified binary scoring
5. Full scoring capability supporting all three methodologies: Life Scenarios (binary), A/B Choice (binary), and SAIS Methodology (5-point distribution)
6. Response caching implemented to optimize performance for concurrent users
7. Error handling returns appropriate fallback responses for invalid inputs and validates 5-point distribution totals for SAIS methodology
8. SAIS methodology scoring prevents ties through 5-point system ensuring clear dimensional preferences

### Story 1.3: Core Foundation Questions Interface
**As a** user seeking personality insights,  
**I want** to answer 4 clear, well-explained core questions about my personality preferences,  
**so that** I can begin discovering my MBTI type without confusion or guesswork.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Landing page explains assessment value proposition and 8-minute time commitment in user's selected language
2. Assessment interface displays one question at a time with clear explanatory text in Arabic or English
3. 4 core questions cover primary MBTI dimensions (E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P) with culturally appropriate contextual descriptions
4. Progress indicator shows current question number and percentage completion with proper RTL alignment for Arabic
5. Question navigation allows moving forward, prevents skipping questions, with RTL-appropriate controls
6. Response data persisted using multi-layer strategy including language preference
7. Mobile-responsive design tested across iOS Safari and Android Chrome for both languages and RTL layouts
8. Assessment state recoverable if user refreshes browser or returns later, maintaining language preference
9. Language switcher available throughout assessment without losing progress
10. Arabic typography renders correctly with proper font selection and text spacing

### Story 1.4: Interim Results & Format Selection
**As a** user who completed the core questions,  
**I want** to see preliminary insights about my personality type and choose how to continue the assessment,  
**so that** I feel validated by early results and can personalize the remaining experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Interim results page displays preliminary MBTI tendencies based on 4 core responses
2. Results include 2-3 key insights about user's likely personality patterns
3. Clear explanation that results will be refined with additional questions
4. "Continue" button prominently displayed to maintain assessment flow
5. Format selection interface presents three clear options: "Life Choice Scenarios," "A/B Personality Traits," and "SAIS Methodology"
6. Each format option includes preview description of question style, scoring method, and result focus
7. User selection stored in assessment state for subsequent question delivery
8. Format choice cannot be changed once selected (prevents gaming)
9. Back navigation to core questions disabled to maintain assessment integrity

### Story 1.5: Arabic Language & Internationalization Implementation
**As an** Arabic-speaking user,  
**I want** to take the complete MBTI assessment in Arabic with proper RTL layout and cultural context,  
**so that** I can have a natural, culturally relevant personality assessment experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Complete Arabic translation system with Next.js i18n integration
2. RTL layout implementation for all Arabic content with proper text alignment and spacing
3. Arabic typography with appropriate fonts (IBM Plex Arabic, Noto Sans Arabic) and fallbacks
4. Language selection interface on landing page with persistent language preference
5. All UI elements, navigation, and interactive components adapted for RTL layout
6. Arabic-specific content for life scenarios that are culturally relevant and appropriate
7. OpenAI API integration supports Arabic language for chatbot interactions
8. Question numbering and progress indicators display correctly in Arabic numerals and RTL context
9. Assessment state persistence includes language preference across all storage layers
10. Language switching capability without losing assessment progress

### Story 1.6: State Management & Recovery System
**As a** user taking the assessment,  
**I want** my progress automatically saved and recoverable,  
**so that** I never lose my responses due to technical issues or interruptions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Assessment progress automatically saved after each question response
2. Multiple persistence layers: localStorage, sessionStorage, and server-side backup
3. State recovery works after browser refresh, tab closure, and device restart
4. Server-side session backup API route stores essential progress data
5. Recovery system detects existing progress and offers to continue or restart
6. State includes question responses, current position, format selection, interim results, and language preference
7. Graceful handling of storage quota exceeded or privacy settings blocking local storage
8. Assessment session expires after 3 hours to maintain data hygiene
9. Cross-language state recovery maintains assessment integrity when switching languages
