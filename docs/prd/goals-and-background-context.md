# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Deliver an engaging 14-question MBTI assessment with 85%+ completion rate
- Provide actionable personality insights that users can immediately apply to life decisions
- Establish scalable foundation for future coaching marketplace integration
- Achieve user satisfaction of 4.5+ stars on result clarity and usefulness
- Generate 20% of users expressing interest in coaching services for future revenue
- Expand market reach through native Arabic language support, targeting Arabic-speaking regions

### Background Context

The MBTI coaching platform addresses critical gaps in existing personality assessment tools that suffer from lengthy formats (60-100+ questions), confusing abstract questions, and information-heavy results that overwhelm rather than empower users. With the coaching industry experiencing 20%+ annual growth and increasing demand for personalized development tools, this platform bridges the gap between personality discovery and actionable professional guidance.

The solution provides a streamlined two-phase adaptive assessment starting with 4 core foundation questions, then allowing users to choose between life choice scenarios or A/B forced choice formats for remaining questions, prioritizing actionable insights over academic descriptions while establishing clear pathways to coaching support.
