# MBTI Coaching Platform MVP Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Deliver an engaging 14-question MBTI assessment with 85%+ completion rate
- Provide actionable personality insights that users can immediately apply to life decisions
- Establish scalable foundation for future coaching marketplace integration
- Achieve user satisfaction of 4.5+ stars on result clarity and usefulness
- Generate 20% of users expressing interest in coaching services for future revenue
- Expand market reach through native Arabic language support, targeting Arabic-speaking regions

### Background Context

The MBTI coaching platform addresses critical gaps in existing personality assessment tools that suffer from lengthy formats (60-100+ questions), confusing abstract questions, and information-heavy results that overwhelm rather than empower users. With the coaching industry experiencing 20%+ annual growth and increasing demand for personalized development tools, this platform bridges the gap between personality discovery and actionable professional guidance.

The solution provides a streamlined two-phase adaptive assessment starting with 4 core foundation questions, then allowing users to choose between life choice scenarios or A/B forced choice formats for remaining questions, prioritizing actionable insights over academic descriptions while establishing clear pathways to coaching support.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The interface should feel like a sophisticated, engaging quiz platform rather than a clinical assessment tool. Users should experience a journey of self-discovery with **interim validation**, **format-specific results**, and clear guidance at every step, eliminating confusion while maintaining engagement through smooth animations, intuitive navigation, and encouraging micro-interactions. The overall experience should feel personal and insightful rather than academic or overwhelming.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Progressive disclosure:** Present one question at a time with clear context, avoiding cognitive overload
- **Interim validation:** After core questions, provide preliminary MBTI insights to build confidence and engagement
- **Choice-driven personalization:** Allow users to select their preferred question format (scenarios vs. A/B choices vs. SAIS methodology) after seeing initial results
- **Contextualized results delivery:** Tailor final results to match the question format chosen (life-focused vs. trait-focused vs. depth-focused insights)
- **Anticipation building:** Use progress indicators and transitions that build excitement toward personalized results
- **Immediate value delivery:** Present actionable insights first, detailed explanations second
- **Conversational guidance:** AI chatbot interactions feel helpful and personalized, not scripted

### Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, the critical screens necessary to deliver PRD value:

- **Landing/Welcome Screen:** Introduces assessment with clear value proposition and time commitment
- **Core Questions Flow:** 4 individual question screens covering primary MBTI dimensions with progress indicators
- **Interim Results Screen:** Small overview showing preliminary MBTI tendencies based on core questions with "Continue" button
- **Format Selection Screen:** Allows users to choose between Life Scenarios, A/B Choice, or SAIS Methodology question styles, with preview of result types
- **Extended Assessment Flow:** 10 additional questions in user's chosen format with continued progress tracking
- **Results Processing Screen:** Dramatic transition building anticipation for personalized results reveal
- **Contextualized Results Dashboard:** 
  - **Life Scenarios → Life-focused results:** Living patterns, thinking styles, decision-making approaches, relationship dynamics
  - **A/B Choice → Trait-focused results:** Professional tendencies, work style preferences, communication patterns
  - **SAIS Methodology → Depth-focused results:** Consciousness-based insights, internal energy dynamics, spiritual and psychological depth
- **Chatbot Interface:** Integrated guidance system for deeper exploration of format-specific results

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The platform should meet WCAG AA standards to ensure broad accessibility, including proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and clear focus indicators throughout the assessment flow.

### Branding

Modern, trustworthy design that conveys professionalism while remaining approachable. Clean typography supporting both Latin and Arabic scripts with appropriate font selections (e.g., IBM Plex Arabic, Noto Sans Arabic), calming color palette that doesn't overwhelm during the assessment process, and subtle animations that enhance rather than distract from the user journey. The aesthetic should inspire confidence in the results while feeling contemporary and engaging across both Western and Arabic cultural contexts.
